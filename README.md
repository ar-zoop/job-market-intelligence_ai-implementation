# Job Market Intelligence System
A backend system that analyzes multiple job descriptions against a candidate’s resume to determine job fit, skill gaps, and high-ROI learning priorities. This is done using LLM-assisted reasoning and deterministic scoring logic.

## Current Status
- JD → JSON normalization using LLM
- Role classification with precedence rules (AI vs AI-adjacent)
- Seniority derived from experience + responsibility scope
